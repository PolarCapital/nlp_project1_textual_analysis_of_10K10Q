# nlp_project1_textual_analysis_of_10K10Q
This project aims to replicate the results from "When is a Liability Not a Liability? Textual Analysis, Dictionaries, and 10-Ks"

The main findings and step explanations are available here in the document report.pdf in this repository.

We provide some example data that we scraped from SEC.gov. We did not upload all the scraped files due to the large size of the files involved. If interested however, you can either run the script parsing_downloading.ipynb, which will download the data into the folder /data, or reach out to me for the actual data files themselves.
