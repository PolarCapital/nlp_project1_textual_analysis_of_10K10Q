table of contentsstock options:the company made stock option grants of 163,786 shares during the twelve week period ended november 20, 2021 and granted options to purchase 194,511 shares during the comparable prior year period. the company grants options to purchase common stock to certain of its employees under its equity incentive plans at prices equal to the market value of the stock on the date of grant. the fair value of each option is amortized into compensation expense on a straight-line basis between the grant date for the award and each vesting date.the weighted average fair value of the stock option awards granted during the twelve week periods ended november 20, 2021 and november 21, 2020, using the black-scholes-merton multiple-option pricing valuation model, was $462.80 and $299.48 per share, respectively, using the following weighted average key assumptions:​​​​​​​​​twelve weeks ended​​    november 20,    november 21,    ​    2021​2020​​​​​​​expected price volatility  28%   28%risk-free interest rate  1.1%   0.4%weighted average expected lives (in years)  5.6  5.6 forfeiture rate  10%   10%dividend yield  0%   0%​during the twelve week period ended november 20, 2021, 47,705 stock options were exercised at a weighted average exercise price of $549.86. in the comparable prior year period, 59,990 stock options were exercised at a weighted average exercise price of $496.58.as of november 20, 2021, total unrecognized share-based expense related to stock options, net of estimated forfeitures, was approximately $98.4 million, before income taxes, which we expect to recognize over an estimated weighted average period of 2.2 years.restricted stock units:restricted stock unit awards are valued at the market price of a share of the company’s stock on the date of grant. grants of employee restricted stock units vest ratably on an annual basis over a four-year service period and are payable in shares of common stock on the vesting date. compensation expense for grants of employee restricted stock units is recognized on a straight-line basis over the four-year service period, less estimated forfeitures, which are consistent with stock option forfeiture assumptions. grants of non-employee director restricted stock units are made and expensed on january 1 of each year, as they vest immediately.as of november 20, 2021, total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to nonvested restricted stock unit awards, net of estimated forfeitures, was approximately $15.6 million, before income taxes, which we expect to recognize over an estimated weighted average period of 2.9 years.transactions related to restricted stock units for the twelve weeks ended november 20, 2021 were as follows:​​​​​​​​​​​weighted-​    number    average grant​​of shares​date fair value​​​​​​nonvested at august 28, 2021  15,751​$ 1,005.41granted  4,352​​ 1,651.22vested  (5,373)​  957.89canceled or forfeited  (696)​  1,023.97nonvested at november 20, 2021  14,034​$ 1,222.96​8

table of contentsitem 2. management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (“md&a”), we provide a historical and prospective narrative of our general financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and certain other factors that may affect the future results of autozone, inc. (“autozone” or the “company”). the following md&a discussion should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements, related notes to those statements and other financial information, including forward-looking statements and risk factors, that appear elsewhere in this quarterly report on form 10-q, our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended august 28, 2021 and other filings we make with the sec.forward-looking statementscertain statements contained in this quarterly report on form 10-q constitute forward-looking statements that are subject to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. forward-looking statements typically use words such as “believe,” “anticipate,” “should,” “intend,” “plan,” “will,” “expect,” “estimate,” “project,” “positioned,” “strategy,” “seek,” “may,” “could,” and similar expressions. these are based on assumptions and assessments made by our management in light of experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors that we believe to be appropriate. these forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including without limitation: product demand; energy prices; weather; competition; credit market conditions; cash flows; access to available and feasible financing; future stock repurchases; the impact of recessionary conditions; consumer debt levels; changes in laws or regulations; risks associated with self -insurance; war and the prospect of war, including terrorist activity; the impact of public health issues, such as the ongoing global coronavirus (“covid-19”) pandemic; inflation; the ability to hire, train and retain qualified employees; construction delays; the compromising of confidentiality, availability or integrity of information, including due to cyber-attacks; historic growth rate sustainability; downgrade of our credit ratings; damage to our reputation; challenges in international markets; failure or interruption of our information technology systems; origin and raw material costs of suppliers; inventory availability; disruption in our supply chain; impact of tariffs; anticipated impact of new accounting standards; and business interruptions. certain of these risks and uncertainties are discussed in more detail in the “risk factors” section contained in item 1a under part 1 of our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended august 28, 2021, and these risk factors should be read carefully. forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, actual results, developments and business decisions may differ from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements, and events described above and in the “risk factors” could materially and adversely affect our business. however, it should be understood that it is not possible to identify or predict all such risks and other factors that could affect these forward-looking statements. forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made. except as required by applicable law, we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.overviewwe are the leading retailer, and a leading distributor, of automotive replacement parts and accessories in the americas. we began operations in 1979 and at november 20, 2021, operated 6,066 stores in the u.s., 666 stores in mexico and 53 stores in brazil. each store carries an extensive product line for cars, sport utility vehicles, vans and light trucks, including new and remanufactured automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories and non-automotive products. at november 20, 2021, in 5,211 of our domestic stores, we also had a commercial sales program that provides commercial credit and prompt delivery of parts and other products to local, regional and national repair garages, dealers, service stations and public sector accounts. we also have commercial programs in all stores in mexico and brazil. we sell the alldata brand automotive diagnostic, repair and shop management software through www.alldata.com. additionally, we sell automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories and non-automotive products through www.autozone.com, and our commercial customers can make purchases through www.autozonepro.com. we also provide product information on our duralast branded products through www.duralastparts.com. we do not derive revenue from automotive repair or installation services.​16
table of contentsoperating results for the twelve weeks ended november 20, 2021 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending august 27, 2022. each of the first three quarters of our fiscal year consists of 12 weeks, and the fourth quarter consists of 16 or 17 weeks. the fourth quarters of fiscal 2022 and 2021 each have 16 weeks. our business is somewhat seasonal in nature, with the highest sales generally occurring during the months of february through september, and the lowest sales generally occurring in the months of december and january. covid-19 impact the covid-19 pandemic continues to impact the global economy and numerous aspects of our business including our customers, employees and suppliers. our highest priority remains the safety and well-being of our customers and employees. since the beginning of the covid-19 pandemic, we have experienced strong same store sales growth and our sales have remained at all-time high volumes.  ​the long-term impact to our business remains unknown, may magnify risks associated with our business and operations and may continue to cause fluctuations in demand for our products, our store hours and our workforce availability. other unknowns include the potential impact of any related vaccine mandates on our workforce. ​please refer to the “risk factors” section of our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended august 28, 2021 for additional information.   ​executive summarynet sales increased 16.3% for the quarter ended november 20, 2021 compared to the prior year period, which was driven by an increase in domestic same store sales (sales from stores open at least one year) of 13.6%. domestic commercial sales increased 29.4%, which represents approximately 25% of our total sales. operating profit increased 22.6% to $754.5 million compared to $615.2 million. net income for the quarter increased 25.5% to $555.2 million compared to $442.4 million. diluted earnings per share increased 38.1% to $25.69 per share from $18.61 per share. the increase in net income for the quarter ended november 20, 2021 was driven by strong topline growth and operating expense leverage.our business is impacted by various factors within the economy that affect both our consumer and our industry, including but not limited to fuel costs, wage rates, supply chain disruptions, hiring and other economic conditions, including the effects of, and responses to, covid-19. given the nature of these macroeconomic factors, we cannot predict whether or for how long certain trends will continue, nor can we predict to what degree these trends will impact us in the future.during the first quarter of fiscal 2022, failure and maintenance related categories represented the largest portion of our sales mix, at approximately 84% of total sales, which is consistent with the comparable prior year period, with failure related categories continuing to be the largest portion of our sales mix. we did not experience any fundamental shifts in our category sales mix as compared to the previous year. our sales mix can be impacted by severe or unusual weather over a short-term period. over the long-term, we believe the impact of the weather on our sales mix is not significant.​​17
table of contentsthe two statistics we believe have the closest correlation to our market growth over the long-term are miles driven and the number of seven year old or older vehicles on the road. while over the long-term we have seen a close correlation between our net sales and the number of miles driven, we have also seen time frames of minimal correlation in sales performance and miles driven. during the periods of minimal correlation between net sales and miles driven, we believe net sales have been positively impacted by other factors, including macroeconomic factors and the number of seven year old or older vehicles on the road. the average age of the u.s. light vehicle fleet continues to trend in our industry’s favor as the average age has exceeded 11 years since 2012, according to the latest data provided by the auto care association. as of january 1, 2021, the average age of light vehicles on the road was 12.1 years. for september 2021 (latest publicly available information), miles driven in the u.s. increased 7.9% compared to the same period in the prior year. we believe the increase in miles driven is due to the nation beginning to return to pre-pandemic levels, but we are unable to predict if the increase will continue or the extent of the impact it will have on our business. twelve weeks ended november 20, 2021compared with twelve weeks ended november 21, 2020net sales for the twelve weeks ended november 20, 2021 increased $514.6 million to $3.7 billion, or 16.3% over net sales of $3.2 billion for the comparable prior year period. total auto parts sales increased by 16.2%, primarily driven by an increase in domestic same store sales of 13.6% and net sales of $68.7 million from new stores. domestic commercial sales increased $204.6 million to $899.9 million, or 29.4%, over the comparable prior year period.gross profit for the twelve weeks ended november 20, 2021 was $1.9 billion, compared with $1.7 billion during the comparable prior year period. gross profit, as a percentage of sales was 52.5% compared to 53.1% during the comparable prior year period. the decrease in gross margin was primarily driven by initiatives to accelerate commercial business growth.operating, selling, general and administrative expenses for the twelve weeks ended november 20, 2021 were $1.2 billion, or 31.9% of net sales, compared with $1.1 billion, or 33.6% of net sales during the comparable prior year period. the decrease in operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, was driven by strong sales growth.net interest expense for the twelve weeks ended november 20, 2021 was $43.3 million compared with $46.2 million during the comparable prior year period. average borrowings for the twelve weeks ended november 20, 2021 were $5.3 billion, compared with $5.5 billion for the comparable prior year period. weighted average borrowing rates were 3.30% and 3.27% for the quarter ended november 20, 2021 and november 21, 2020, respectively.our effective income tax rate was 21.9% of pretax income for the twelve weeks ended november 20, 2021, and 22.2% for the comparable prior year period. the decrease in the tax rate was primarily attributable to an increased benefit from stock options exercised during the twelve weeks ended november 20, 2021. the benefit of stock options exercised for the twelve weeks ended november 20, 2021 was $11.3 million compared to $7.6 million in the comparable prior year period.net income for the twelve week period ended november 20, 2021 increased by $112.8 million to $555.2 million from $442.4 million in the comparable prior year period, and diluted earnings per share increased by 38.1% to $25.69 from $18.61. the impact on current quarter diluted earnings per share from stock repurchases since the end of the comparable prior year period was an increase of $2.33.​18
table of contentsliquidity and capital resourcesthe primary source of our liquidity is our cash flows realized through the sale of automotive parts, products and accessories. our cash flow results benefitted from the quarters strong sales and continued progress on our initiatives. we believe that our cash generated from operating activities, available cash reserves and available credit, supplemented with our long-term borrowings will provide ample liquidity to fund our operations while allowing us to make strategic investments to support long-term growth initiatives and return excess cash to shareholders in the form of share repurchases. as of november 20, 2021, we held $961.1 million of cash and cash equivalents, as well as $2.2 billion in undrawn capacity on our revolving credit facility. we believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be adequate to fund our operations and investments to grow our business, repay our debt as it becomes due and fund our share repurchases over the short-term and long-term. in addition, we believe we have the ability to obtain alternative sources of financing, if necessary. however, decreased demand for our products or changes in customer buying patterns would negatively impact our ability to generate cash from operating activities. decreased demand or changes in buying patterns could also impact our ability to meet our debt covenants of our credit agreements and, therefore, negatively impact the funds available under our revolving credit facility. in the event our liquidity is insufficient, we may be required to limit our spending. for the twelve weeks ended november 20, 2021, our net cash flows from operating activities provided $777.9 million compared with $683.5 million provided during the comparable prior year period. the increase is primarily due to growth in net income due to accelerated sales growth and a result of favorable changes in accounts payable, driven by higher sustained inventory purchase volume in the current period as compared to the same period in the prior year. these favorable changes were partially offset by a smaller increase in accrued benefits and withholdings in the current period, as compared to the same period in the prior year due to the ability to defer certain payroll tax payments in the prior year under the coronavirus aid, relief, and economic security act. our net cash flows used in investing activities for the twelve weeks ended november 20, 2021 were $91.0 million as compared with $110.2 million in the comparable prior year period. capital expenditures for the twelve weeks ended november 20, 2021 were $102.3 million compared to $113.0 million in the comparable prior year period. the decrease is primarily driven by decreased store openings. during the twelve week period ended november 20, 2021 and november 21, 2020, we opened 18 and 41 net new stores, respectively. investing cash flows were impacted by our wholly owned captive, which purchased $7.0 million and sold $3.7 million in marketable debt securities during the twelve weeks ended november 20, 2021. during the comparable prior year period, the captive purchased $46.0 million in marketable debt securities and sold $51.2 million.our net cash flows used in financing activities for the twelve weeks ended november 20, 2021 were $895.9 million compared to $663.4 million in the comparable prior year period. stock repurchases were $900.0 million in the current twelve week period as compared with $678.3 million in the prior year period. the treasury stock repurchases were primarily funded by cash flows from operations. proceeds from the sale of common stock and exercises of stock options for the twelve weeks ended november 20, 2021 and november 21, 2020 provided $21.1 million and $28.7 million, respectively.during fiscal 2022, we expect to increase the investment in our business as compared to fiscal 2021. our investments are expected to be directed primarily to expansion of our store base and supply chain to fuel the growth of our domestic and international businesses, which includes new stores, including mega hubs, as well as distribution center expansions and remodels. the amount of investments in our new stores is impacted by different factors, including whether the building and land are purchased (requiring higher investment) or leased (generally lower investment) and whether such buildings are located in the u.s., mexico or brazil, or located in urban or rural areas.​19
table of contentsin addition to the building and land costs, our new stores require working capital, predominantly for inventories. historically, we have negotiated extended payment terms from suppliers, reducing the working capital required and resulting in a high accounts payable to inventory ratio. we plan to continue leveraging our inventory purchases; however, our ability to do so may be limited by our vendors’ capacity to factor their receivables from us. certain vendors participate in arrangements with financial institutions whereby they factor their autozone receivables, allowing them to receive early payment from the financial institution on our invoices at a discounted rate. the terms of these agreements are between the vendor and the financial institution. upon request from the vendor, we confirm to the vendor’s financial institution the balances owed to the vendor, the due date and agree to waive any right of offset to the confirmed balances. a downgrade in our credit or changes in the financial markets may limit the financial institutions’ willingness to participate in these arrangements, which may result in the vendor wanting to renegotiate payment terms. a reduction in payment terms would increase the working capital required to fund future inventory investments. extended payment terms from our vendors have allowed us to continue our high accounts payable to inventory ratio. accounts payable, as a percentage of gross inventory, was 129.4% at november 20, 2021, compared to 114.1% at november 21, 2020. the increase from the comparable prior year period was primarily due to increased purchases with favorable vendor terms and higher inventory turns. depending on the timing and magnitude of our future investments (either in the form of leased or purchased properties or acquisitions), we anticipate that we will rely primarily on internally generated funds and available borrowing capacity to support a majority of our capital expenditures, working capital requirements and stock repurchases. the balance may be funded through new borrowings. we anticipate that we will be able to obtain such financing based on our current credit ratings and favorable experiences in the debt markets in the past.​for the trailing four quarters ended november 20, 2021, our adjusted after-tax return on invested capital (“roic”), which is a non-gaap measure, was 44.7% as compared to 36.0% for the comparable prior year period. adjusted roic is calculated as after-tax operating profit (excluding rent charges) divided by invested capital (which includes a factor to capitalize operating leases). we use adjusted roic to evaluate whether we are effectively using our capital resources and believe it is an important indicator of our overall operating performance. refer to the “reconciliation of non-gaap financial measures” section for further details of our calculation.debt facilities on november 15, 2021, we amended and restated our existing revolving credit facility (the “revolving credit agreement”) pursuant to which our borrowing capacity under the revolving credit agreement was increased from $2.0 billion to $2.25 billion and the maximum borrowing under the revolving credit agreement may, at our option, subject to lenders approval, be increased from $2.25 billion to $3.25 billion. the revolving credit agreement will terminate, and all amounts borrowed will be due and payable, on november 15, 2026, but we may make up to two requests to extend the termination date for an additional period of one year each. revolving borrowings under the revolving credit agreement may be base rate loans, eurodollar loans, or a combination of both, at our election. the revolving credit agreement includes (i) a $75 million sublimit for swingline loans, (ii) a $50 million individual issuer letter of credit sublimit and (iii) a $250 million aggregate sublimit for all letters of credit.under our revolving credit agreement, covenants include restrictions on liens, a maximum debt to earnings ratio, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a change of control provision that may require acceleration of the repayment obligations under certain circumstances. as of november 20, 2021, we had no outstanding borrowings, $1.8 million of outstanding letters of credit and $2.2 billion of availability under our revolving credit agreement.we also maintain a letter of credit facility that allows us to request the participating bank to issue letters of credit on our behalf up to an aggregate amount of $25 million. the letter of credit facility is in addition to the letters of credit that may be issued under the revolving credit agreement. as of november 20, 2021, we had $25.0 million in letters of credit outstanding under the letter of credit facility, which expires in june 2022.20
table of contentsin addition to the outstanding letters of credit issued under the committed facilities discussed above, we had $143.8 million in letters of credit outstanding as of november 20, 2021. these letters of credit have various maturity dates and were issued on an uncommitted basis.as of november 20, 2021, the $500 million 3.700% senior notes due april 2022 are classified as current in the consolidated balance sheets as the company has the intent to utilize operating cash to fund the repayment. all senior notes are subject to an interest rate adjustment if the debt ratings assigned are downgraded (as defined in the agreements). further, the senior notes contain a provision that repayment may be accelerated if we experience a change in control (as defined in the agreements). our borrowings under our senior notes contain minimal covenants, primarily restrictions on liens, sale and leaseback transactions and consolidations, mergers and the sale of assets. all of the repayment obligations under our borrowing arrangements may be accelerated and come due prior to the applicable scheduled payment date if covenants are breached or an event of default occurs. as of november 20, 2021, we were in compliance with all covenants and expect to remain in compliance with all covenants under our borrowing arrangements.our adjusted debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rent and share-based compensation expense (“ebitdar”) ratio was 2.0:1 as of november 20, 2021 and was 2.3:1 as of november 21, 2020. we calculate adjusted debt as the sum of total debt, financing lease liabilities and rent times six; and we calculate adjusted ebitdar by adding interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rent, and share-based compensation expense to net income. adjusted debt to ebitdar is calculated on a trailing four quarter basis. we target our debt levels to a ratio of adjusted debt to ebitdar in order to maintain our investment grade credit ratings. we believe this is important information for the management of our debt levels. management expects the ratio of adjusted debt to ebitdar to return to pre-pandemic levels in the future, increasing debt levels. once the target ratio is achieved, to the extent adjusted ebitdar increases, we expect our debt levels to increase; conversely, if adjusted ebitdar decreases, we would expect our debt levels to decrease. refer to the “reconciliation of non-gaap financial measures” section for further details of our calculation.stock repurchasesfrom january 1, 1998 to november 20, 2021, we have repurchased a total of 150.8 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $26.6 billion, including 514,534 shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $900.0 million during the twelve week period ended november 20, 2021.on october 5, 2021, the board voted to authorize the repurchase of an additional $1.5 billion of our common stock in connection with our ongoing share repurchase program. since the inception of the repurchase program in 1998, the board has authorized $27.7 billion in share repurchases. considering the cumulative repurchases as of november 20, 2021, we had $1.0 billion remaining under the board’s authorization to repurchase our common stock. subsequent to november 20, 2021 and through december 10, 2021, we have repurchased 63,909 shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $120.0 million. on december 14, 2021, the board voted to increase the authorization by $1.5 billion to raise the cumulative share repurchase authorization to $29.2 billion. considering the cumulative repurchases subsequent to november 20, 2021 and through december 10, 2021 and the december 14, 2021 additional authorization, we have $2.4 billion remaining under the board’s authorization to repurchase our common stock.off-balance sheet arrangementssince our fiscal year end, we have canceled, issued and modified stand-by letters of credit that are primarily renewed on an annual basis to cover deductible payments to our casualty insurance carriers. our total stand-by letters of credit commitment at november 20, 2021, was $170.6 million, compared with $162.4 million at august 28, 2021, and our total surety bonds commitment at november 20, 2021, was $36.8 million, compared with $35.4 million at august 28, 2021.21
