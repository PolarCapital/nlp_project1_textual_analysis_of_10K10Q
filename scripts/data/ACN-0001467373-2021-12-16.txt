companies have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission (“sec”) for quarterly reports on form 10-q and do not include all of the information and note disclosures required by u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (“u.s. gaap”) for complete financial statements. we use the terms “accenture,” “we” and “our” in the notes to consolidated financial statements to refer to accenture plc and its subsidiaries. these consolidated financial statements should therefore be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the fiscal year ended august 31, 2021 included in our annual report on form 10-k filed with the sec on october 15, 2021. the accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying disclosures. although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of current events and actions that we may undertake in the future, actual results may differ from those estimates. the consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments of a normal, recurring nature that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of results for these interim periods. the results of operations for the three months ended november 30, 2021 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending august 31, 2022.allowance for credit losses - client receivables and contract assets as of november 30, 2021 and august 31, 2021, the total allowance for credit losses recorded for client receivables and contract assets was $32,521 and $32,206, respectively. the change in the allowance is primarily due to immaterial write-offs and changes in gross client receivables and contract assets. investmentsall available-for-sale securities and liquid investments with an original maturity greater than three months but less than one year are considered to be short-term investments. non-current investments consist of equity securities in publicly-traded and privately-held companies and are accounted for using either the equity or fair value measurement alternative method of accounting (for investments without readily determinable fair values).our non-current investments are as follows:november 30, 2021august 31, 2021equity method investments$177,119 $184,157 investments without readily determinable fair values148,595 145,369 total non-current investments$325,714 $329,526 for investments in which we can exercise significant influence but do not control, we use the equity method of accounting. equity method investments are initially recorded at cost and our proportionate share of gains and losses of the investee are included as a component of other income (expense), net. our equity method investments consist primarily of an investment in duck creek technologies. as of november 30, 2021, the carrying amount of our investment was $156,574, and the estimated fair value of our approximately 16% ownership was $524,113. we account for the investment under the equity method because we have the ability to influence operations through the combination of our voting power and through other factors, such as representation on the board and our business relationship. table of contentsnotes to consolidated financial statements(in thousands of u.s. dollars, except share and per

we early adopted fasb asu no. 2021-08, business combinations (topic 805): accounting for contract assets and contract liabilities from contracts with customers, which requires an acquirer to recognize and measure contract assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606) rather than adjust them to fair value at the acquisition date. the adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.table of contentsnotes to consolidated financial statements(in thousands of u.s. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed)accenture form 10-q112. revenuesdisaggregation of revenue see note 11 (segment reporting) to these consolidated financial statements for our disaggregated revenues. remaining performance obligations we had remaining performance obligations of approximately $23 billion as of november 30, 2021 and august 31, 2021. our remaining performance obligations represent the amount of transaction price for which work has not been performed and revenue has not been recognized. the majority of our contracts are terminable by the client on short notice with little or no termination penalties, and some without notice. under topic 606, only the non-cancelable portion of these contracts is included in our performance obligations. additionally, our performance obligations only include variable consideration if we assess it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty is resolved. based on the terms of our contracts, a significant portion of what we consider contract bookings is not included in our remaining performance obligations. we expect to recognize approximately 65% of our remaining performance obligations as of november 30, 2021 as revenue in fiscal 2022, an additional 19% in fiscal 2023, and the balance thereafter.  contract estimates adjustments in contract estimates related to performance obligations satisfied or partially satisfied in prior periods were immaterial for the three months ended november 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. contract balances deferred transition revenues were $701,629 and $700,080 as of november 30, 2021 and august 31, 2021, respectively, and are included in non-current deferred revenues. costs related to these activities are also deferred and are expensed as the services are provided. deferred transition costs were $751,939 and $731,445 as of november 30, 2021 and august 31, 2021, respectively, and are included in deferred contract costs. generally, deferred amounts are protected in the event of early termination of the contract and are monitored regularly for impairment. impairment losses are recorded when projected remaining undiscounted operating cash flows of the related contract are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of contract assets.the following table provides information about the balances of our receivables and contract assets, net of allowance, and contract liabilities (deferred revenues): as of november 30, 2021as of august 31,

derivative financial instruments consist of deliverable and non-deliverable foreign currency forward contracts. cash flow hedges for a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the change in estimated fair value of a hedging instrument is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss as a separate component of shareholders’ equity and is reclassified into cost of services in the consolidated income statements during the period in which the hedged transaction is recognized. for information related to derivatives designated as cash flow hedges that were reclassified into cost of services during the three months ended november 30, 2021 and 2020, as well as those expected to be reclassified into cost of services in the next 12 months, see note 4 (accumulated other comprehensive loss) to these consolidated financial statements. other derivatives realized gains or losses and changes in the estimated fair value of foreign currency forward contracts that have not been designated as hedges were net losses of $23,479 and net gains of $28,324 for the three months ended november 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. gains and losses on these contracts are recorded in other income (expense), net in the consolidated income statements and are offset by gains and losses on the related hedged items. fair value of derivative instruments the notional and fair values of all derivative instruments are as follows: november 30, 2021august 31, 2021assetscash flow hedgesother current assets$76,213 $109,416 other non-current assets44,558 70,250 other derivativesother current

provisions for the netting of certain foreign currency transaction obligations and for the set-off of certain obligations in the event of an insolvency of one of the parties to the transaction. in the

consolidated financial statements(in thousands of u.s. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed)accenture form 10-q179. income taxeswe apply an estimated annual effective tax rate to our year-to-date operating results to determine the interim provision for income tax expense. in addition, we recognize taxes related to unusual or infrequent items or resulting from a change in judgment regarding a position taken in a prior year as discrete items in the interim period in which the event occurs. our effective tax rates for the three months ended november 30, 2021 and 2020 were 24.4% and 23.4%, respectively. absent the $119,700 gain on our investment in duck creek technologies and related $22,906 in tax expense, our effective tax rate for the three months ended november 30, 2020 would have been 23.7%. the effective tax rate for the three months ended november 30, 2021 was higher primarily due to tax expense from adjustments to prior year tax liabilities, partially offset by changes in the geographic distribution of earnings and higher tax benefits from share-based payments. 10. commitments and contingencies indemnifications and guarantees in the normal course of business and in conjunction with certain client engagements, we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters. as of november 30, 2021 and august 31, 2021, our aggregate potential liability to our clients for expressly limited guarantees involving the performance of third parties was approximately $867,000 and $885,000, respectively, of which all but approximately $76,000 and $78,000, respectively, may be recovered from the other third parties if we are obligated to make payments to the indemnified parties as a consequence of a performance default by the other third parties. for arrangements with unspecified limitations, we cannot reasonably estimate the aggregate maximum potential liability, as it is inherently difficult to predict the maximum potential amount of such payments, due to the conditional nature and unique facts of each particular arrangement. to date, we have not been required to make any significant payment under any of the arrangements described above. we have assessed the current status of performance/payment risk related to arrangements with limited guarantees, warranty obligations, unspecified limitations and/or indemnification provisions and believe that any potential payments would be immaterial to the consolidated financial statements, as a whole. legal contingencies as of november 30, 2021, we or our present personnel had been named as a defendant in various litigation matters. we and/or our personnel also from time to time are involved in investigations by various regulatory or legal authorities concerning matters arising in the course of our business around the world. based on the present status of these matters, management believes the range of reasonably possible losses in addition to amounts accrued, net of insurance recoveries, will not have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition.on july 24, 2019, accenture was named in a putative class action lawsuit filed by consumers of marriott international, inc. (“marriott”) in the u.s. district court for the district of maryland. the complaint alleges negligence by us, and seeks monetary damages, costs and attorneys’ fees and other related relief, relating to a data security incident involving unauthorized access to the reservations database of starwood worldwide resorts, inc. (“starwood”), which was acquired by marriott on september 23, 2016. since 2009, we have provided certain it infrastructure outsourcing services to starwood. on october 27, 2020, the court issued an order largely denying accenture’s motion to dismiss the claims against us. we continue to believe the lawsuit is without merit and we will vigorously defend it. at present, we do not believe any losses from this matter will have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition.table of contentsnotes to consolidated financial statements(in thousands of u.s. dollars, except

global professional services company, providing a broad range of services in strategy and consulting, interactive, technology and operations. we serve clients in three geographic markets: north america, europe and growth markets (asia pacific, latin america, africa and the middle east). we help our clients build their digital core, transform their operations, and accelerate revenue growth—creating tangible value across their enterprises at speed and scale. we saw very strong demand across our business in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 as our clients continue their digital transformations. highlights from the first quarter of fiscal 2022 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2021 included:•revenues of $15.0 billion, representing 27% growth in both u.s. dollars and local currency;•new bookings of $16.8 billion, an increase of 30% in both u.s. dollars and local currency;•operating margin of 16.3%, a 20 basis point expansion; and•cash returned to shareholders of $1.5 billion, including share purchases of $845 million and dividends of $613 million.revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 increased 27% in both u.s. dollars and local currency compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2021. during the first quarter of fiscal 2022, revenue growth in local currency was very strong across all geographic markets, industry groups and types of work. the business environment remained competitive. in many areas, our pricing, which we define as the contract profitability or margin on the work that we sell, improved.in our consulting business, revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 increased 33% in u.s. dollars and 32% in local currency compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2021. consulting revenue in local currency for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 was driven by very strong growth in growth markets, europe and north america. our consulting revenue continues to be driven by helping our clients accelerate their digital transformation, including moving to the cloud, embedding security across the enterprise and adopting new technologies. in addition, clients continue to be focused on initiatives designed to deliver cost savings and operational efficiency, as well as projects to accelerate growth and improve customer experiences.in our outsourcing business, revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 increased 21% in both u.s. dollars and local currency compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2021. outsourcing revenue in local currency for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 was driven by very strong growth in north america, growth markets and europe. we continue to experience growing demand to assist clients with application modernization and maintenance, cloud enablement and managed security services. in addition, clients continue to be focused on transforming their operations through data and analytics, automation and artificial intelligence to drive productivity and operational cost savings.as we are a global company, our revenues are denominated in multiple currencies and may be significantly affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations. the majority of our revenues are denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar, including the euro, japanese yen and u.k. pound. there continues to be volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have had and could in the future have a material effect on our financial results. if the u.s. dollar weakens against other currencies, resulting in favorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in u.s. dollars may be higher. if the u.s. dollar strengthens against other currencies, resulting in unfavorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in u.s. dollars may be lower. the u.s. dollar weakened against various currencies during the first quarter of fiscal 2022 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2021, resulting in minimal currency translation impact. assuming that exchange rates stay within recent ranges for the remainder of fiscal 2022, we estimate that our full fiscal 2022 revenue growth in u.s. dollars will be approximately 3% lower than our revenue growth in local currency.the primary categories of operating expenses include cost of services, sales and marketing and general and administrative costs. cost of services is primarily driven by the cost of client-service personnel, which consists mainly of compensation, subcontractor and other personnel costs, and non-payroll costs on outsourcing contracts. cost of services includes a variety of activities such as: contract delivery; recruiting and training; software development; and integration of acquisitions. sales and marketing costs are driven primarily by: compensation costs for business development activities; marketing- and advertising-related activities; and certain acquisition-related costs. general and administrative costs primarily include costs for non-client-facing personnel, information systems, office space and certain acquisition-related costs.utilization for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 was 92%, down from 93% in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. we hire to meet current and projected future demand. we proactively plan and manage the size and composition of our workforce and take actions as needed to address changes in the anticipated demand for our services and solutions, given that compensation costs are the most significant portion of our operating expenses. our workforce, the majority of which serves our clients, increased to approximately 674,000 as of november 30, 2021, compared to approximately 514,000 as of november 30, 2020. the year-over-year increase in our workforce reflects an overall increase in demand for our services and solutions, as well as people added in connection with acquisitions. annualized attrition, excluding involuntary terminations, for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 was 17%, compared to 9% in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. we evaluate voluntary attrition, adjust levels of new hiring and use involuntary table of contentsaccenture form 10-qitem 2. management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 22terminations as a means to match people and skills with client demand. in addition, we adjust compensation in order to attract and retain appropriate numbers of qualified employees. for the majority of our personnel, compensation increases become effective december 1st of each fiscal year. we strive to adjust pricing and/or the mix of people to reduce the impact of compensation increases on our margin. during fiscal 2021, we adjusted compensation in line with the increasing market relevant pay around the world. in addition, due to strong demand for our services in the first quarter, we are hiring significantly more people at a time when compensation is increasing, as compared to prior years. we are increasing our pricing and changing the mix of people to reduce the impact of these compensation increases on our margin; however, the impact of the pricing improvements is lagging the impact of these compensation increases. our ability to grow our revenues and maintain or increase our margin could be adversely affected if we are unable to: match people and skills with the types or amounts of services and solutions clients are demanding; recover increases in compensation; deploy our employees globally on a timely basis; manage attrition; and/or effectively assimilate and utilize new employees.gross margin (revenues less cost of services as a percentage of revenues) for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 was 32.9%, compared with 33.1% for the first quarter of fiscal 2021. the decrease in gross margin for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 was due to higher labor, including increased usage of subcontractors, and higher acquisition-related costs, partially offset by a decrease in non-payroll costs compared to the same period in fiscal 2021.sales and marketing and general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues was 16.6% for the first quarter of fiscal 2022, compared with 17.1% for the first quarter of fiscal 2021. for the first quarter of fiscal 2022, compared to the same period in fiscal 2021, sales and marketing costs decreased 70 basis points due to lower business development costs as a percentage of revenues and general and administrative costs increased 30 basis points due to higher non-payroll costs as a percentage of revenues.operating margin (operating income as a percentage of revenues) for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 was 16.3%, compared with 16.1% for the first quarter of fiscal 2021.during the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we recorded gains of $120 million and tax expense of $23 million related to our investment in duck creek technologies. for additional information, see note 1 (basis of presentation) to our consolidated financial statements under item 1, “financial statements.”the effective tax rates for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 and 2021 were 24.4% and 23.4%, respectively. absent the investment gains and related tax expense, our effective tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 would have been 23.7%.diluted earnings per share were $2.78 for the first quarter of fiscal 2022, compared with $2.32 for the first quarter of fiscal 2021. the $97 million investment gains, net of taxes, increased diluted earnings per share by $0.15 during the first quarter of fiscal 2021. excluding the impact of these gains, diluted earnings per share would have been $2.17 for the first quarter of fiscal 2021.we have presented our effective tax rate and diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of fiscal 2021, excluding the impact of the investment gains, as we believe doing so facilitates understanding as to the impact of these items and our performance in comparison to the prior period.new bookingsnew bookings for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 were $16.8 billion, with consulting bookings of $9.4 billion and outsourcing bookings of $7.4 billion. new bookings for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 were $12.9 billion, with consulting bookings of $6.6 billion and outsourcing bookings of $6.3 billion.table of

income increased primarily due to revenue growth, partially offset by lower contract profitability.other income (expense), netother income (expense), net primarily consists of foreign currency gains and losses, non-operating components of pension expense, as well as gains and losses associated with our investments. during the first quarter of fiscal 2022, other income (expense), net decreased $117 million from the first quarter of fiscal 2021, primarily due to lower gains on investments. for additional information, see note 1 (basis of presentation) to our consolidated financial statements under item 1, “financial statements.”income tax expensethe effective tax rates for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 and 2021 were 24.4% and 23.4%, respectively. absent the $120 million investment gains and related $23 million in tax expense, our effective tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 would have been 23.7%. the higher effective tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 was primarily due to tax expense from adjustments to prior year tax liabilities, partially offset by changes in the geographic distribution of earnings and higher tax benefits from share-based payments.table of contentsaccenture form 10-qitem 2. management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 25our provision for income taxes is based on many factors and subject to volatility year to year. we expect the fiscal 2022 annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 23.0% to 25.0%. the effective tax rate for interim periods can vary because of the timing of when certain events occur during the year.earnings per sharediluted earnings per share were $2.78 for the first quarter of fiscal 2022, compared with $2.32 for the first quarter of fiscal 2021. the

have been $2.17 for first quarter of fiscal 2021. for information regarding our earnings per share calculations, see note 3 (earnings per share) to our consolidated financial statements under item 1,

from clients and contract assets as well as higher spending on certain compensation payments, partially offset by higher net income.investing activities: the $1,466 million increase in cash used was primarily due to higher spending on business acquisitions, lower proceeds from the sale of businesses and investments, and higher spending on purchases of property and equipment. for additional information, see note 5 (business combinations) to our consolidated financial statements under item 1, “financial statements.”financing activities: the $70 million increase in cash used was primarily due to an increase in the net purchases of shares as well as an increase in cash dividends paid, partially offset by an increase in net proceeds from share issuances. for additional information, see note 7 (shareholders’ equity) to our consolidated financial statements under item 1, “financial statements.”we believe that our current and longer-term working capital, investments and other general corporate funding requirements will be satisfied for the next twelve months and thereafter through cash flows from operations and, to the extent necessary, from our borrowing facilities and future financial market activities. substantially all of our cash is held in jurisdictions where there are no regulatory restrictions or material tax effects on the free flow of funds. domestic cash inflows for our irish parent, principally dividend distributions from lower-tier subsidiaries, have been sufficient to meet our historic cash requirements, and we expect this to continue into the future.

payroll tax obligations due from employees and former employees in connection with the delivery of accenture plc class a ordinary shares under those plans. these purchases of shares in connection with employee share plans do not affect our aggregate available authorization for our publicly announced open-market share purchase and the other share purchase programs. we intend to continue to use a significant portion of cash generated from operations for share repurchases during the remainder of fiscal 2022. the number of shares ultimately repurchased under our open-market share purchase program may vary depending on numerous factors, including, without limitation, share price and other market conditions, our ongoing capital allocation planning, the levels of cash and debt balances, other demands for cash, such as acquisition activity, general economic and/or business conditions, and board and management discretion. additionally, as these factors may change over the course of the year, the amount of share repurchase activity during any particular period cannot be predicted and may fluctuate from time to time. share repurchases may be made from time to time through open-market purchases, in respect of purchases and redemptions of accenture canada holdings inc. exchangeable shares, through the use of rule 10b5-1 plans and/or by other means. the repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time, without notice. off-balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business and in conjunction with some client engagements, we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters. to date, we have not been required to make any significant payment under any of the arrangements described above. for further discussion of these transactions, see note 10 (commitments and contingencies) to our consolidated financial statements under item 1, “financial
